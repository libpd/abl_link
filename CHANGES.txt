v0.5: 2020 Feb 18

abl_link~ accepts an [offset( message that allows users to improve synchronization on platforms that don't report their latency. This message has been around for a long time, but it was undocumented because the Link specification frowns upon exposed configuration settings. In practice, however, this feature is hard to avoid, and so we make it official by documenting it.

v0.4: 2018 Mar 05

This release updates the code of abl_link~ so that it builds with Link 3.0, and it adds support for setting and receiving the play state of the Link session; see help patch for details.
